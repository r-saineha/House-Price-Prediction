## House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Overview

This project is a Machine Learning and Data Analytics application that predicts house prices based on various property features. The model is built using a Random Forest Regressor with a Scikit-learn Pipeline for preprocessing and prediction. A Streamlit web application provides an interactive interface where users can enter house details, receive an estimated price, and explore the dataset through visual analytics.

## Features

- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Joblib
## Dataset Features

## The model predicts house prices using features such as:

- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Living Area
- Lot Area
- Floors
- Waterfront
- View Rating
- House Condition
- Above Ground Area
- Basement Area
- Year Built
- Year Renovated
- Street
- City
- State Zip
- Country
- Sale Date (converted into Year, Month, and Day)
## Machine Learning Workflow
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Handle missing values using SimpleImputer.
- Encode categorical features using OneHotEncoder.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train a Random Forest Regressor.
- Evaluate the model using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score.
- Save the trained model using Joblib.
- Deploy the model with Streamlit for real-time predictions.
## Data Analytics

The application includes multiple visualizations to help understand the dataset:

- House Price Distribution
- Correlation Heatmap
- Bedrooms vs Price
- Bathrooms vs Price
- Living Area vs Price
- House Condition Distribution
- Waterfront Analysis
- Top 10 Cities by Number of Houses
- Feature Importance Chart
